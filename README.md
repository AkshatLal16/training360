# training360

This is my first project. It just an informative website. And I want to contribute this project to github community. I have used **Django** framework of **Python**.

## Features
* You can add an user through admin panel only.
* I have add an additional dashboard to provide comfort to those who don't want to use Django admin panel.
* You can add news, featured stories, ranks or courses. 

## Requirements:
* Python==3.7.3
* Django==2.2.2
* django-crispy-forms==1.7.2

## Installing
* At first you have to install python3(or higher) in your system from this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Now install django using this command `pip install django` and then rest of the libraries.
* We are using sqlite3.
> Note:
> If you want to user SQLite or PostgreSQL then you to configure the **settings.py** file for using any these database. For instance, I am using MySQL for managing the database. You can learn more to how to configure database from this link [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/databases/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/databases/).
